# Visual Pinball Engine

*An engine for creating and re-creating pinball machines, virtually.*

[![build](https://github.com/freezy/VisualPinball.Engine/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/freezy/VisualPinball.Engine/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/freezy/VisualPinball.Engine/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=gyLOj3al3T)](https://codecov.io/gh/freezy/VisualPinball.Engine) [![UPM Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/org.visualpinball.engine.unity?label=org.visualpinball.engine.unity&registry_uri=https://registry.visualpinball.org&color=%2333cf57&logo=unity&style=flat)](https://registry.visualpinball.org/-/web/detail/org.visualpinball.engine.unity)

VPE is a toolkit with the goal of making it easy to create pinball machines 
digitally. It uses [Unity's High Definition Render Pipeline](https://unity.com/srp/High-Definition-Render-Pipeline)
and comes with extensive editor tooling that aims to provide all the features
needed for such a task. VPE can read [Visual Pinball](https://github.com/vpinball/vpinball)'s
file format and uses Visual Pinball's physics code for the simulation during gameplay.

## History

The project started in late 2019 and is still actively being developed. We're part of the
virtual pinball community and as such, this project is a community effort. The following is
a list of relevant posts that document the progress of VPE so far.

During that time, we've also written [a guest article at thisweekinpinball.com](https://www.thisweekinpinball.com/a-peek-into-the-digital-creator-community/) about our community..


## VPE Repositories

The "core" of VPE (i.e. the `VisualPinball.Engine` project) is a pure C# port
of the original Visual Pinball. It has no dependencies to any proprietary third
parties, and provides the data layer.

This repository is part of a number of packages. It is what we're referring to as the **main package**, which
also includes the core project.
