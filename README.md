## Why?

Today we have nice game engines like Unity or Godot that support C# out of the
box. The goal of VPE is to easily provide what Visual Pinball makes so great to
other "current gen" engines, while keeping backwards-compatibility.

VPE also aims to significantly improve the editor experience by extending the 
editor of the game engine.

For a more detailed overview, header over to the [website](https://docs.visualpinball.org/creators-guide/introduction/overview.html)!

## How?

The "core" of VPE (i.e. the `VisualPinball.Engine` project) is a pure C# port
of the original Visual Pinball. It has no dependencies to any proprietary third
parties, and provides the data layer.

We're currently focusing on Unity as a game engine. Visual Pinball's physics
engine has been ported to [DOTS](https://unity.com/dots), and we're focusing
on Unity's [HDRP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@10.0/manual/index.html)
for the visuals.

## Current Status

VPE is still work in progress. You can check the current features list [here](https://docs.visualpinball.org/creators-guide/introduction/features.html)
and the open issues [here](https://github.com/freezy/VisualPinball.Engine/issues).

There are a few videos in the [VPF thread](https://www.vpforums.org/index.php?showtopic=43651), 
where you can discuss. Screenshots are [here](https://github.com/freezy/VisualPinball.Engine/wiki/Unity-Screenshots! :)
