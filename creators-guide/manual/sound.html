<h1 id="sound">Sound</h1>

<p>Unity, the game engine VPE is built on top of, provides many useful audio
features out of the box. It can import and play several common audio file
formats, it supports directional audio and surround sound and provides mixing
and mastering functionality. For a comprehensive overview, refer to the
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Audio.html">Unity documentation</a>.
On top of this built-in functionality, VPE provides some features specific to
pinball.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-sound-files">Preparing Sound Files</h2>
<p>Before you can use a sound file in your VPE table, you must import it into
Unity. This can be as simple as adding a file of a supported type (.aif, .wav,
.mp3, .ogg) to your project folder, but there are a few things you should
consider:</p>
<h3 id="encoding">Encoding</h3>
<p>No matter what format your file is on disk and no matter what settings you chose
when exporting it, Unity will transcode and compress your audio file differently
depending on the platform it runs on. This means you should prioritize audio
quality over small file size when creating your files. The standard practice
among Unity developers is to use uncompressed .wav files to avoid double
compression and achieve the highest possible quality on any platform.</p>
<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>
<p>Use a single channel (mono audio) for any spatial sounds. For example, do not
export the sound effect for your plunger with a louder right channel just
because the plunger is on the right side of your playfield. Unity can
dynamically change the volume per channel depending on the locations of the
listener and the audio source. If you already have mechanical sound effects in
stereo format, you can mix them down to mono in Unity's import settings. For
anything that would come out of the speakers in a real pinball machine, such as
music and callouts, you can use stereo sounds if you want.</p>
<h3 id="loudness">Loudness</h3>
<p>All your sound files should have a subjectively similar loudness relative to
each other so you don't have to mess around with volume sliders in Unity just to
equalize the volume. Any volume mixing you do in Unity should be done to make
certain sounds louder than others, not the other way around. The overall
loudness of your table should also be consistent with other VPE tables and other
software in general so that players don't have to fiddle around with their
volume controls every time they open your table.</p>
<p>Unity does not have the ability to normalize the loudness of your audio files,
but the free audio editing software <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>
does:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import your file(s) into Audacity</li>
<li>Press <code>Ctrl + A</code> to select all</li>
<li>In the toolbar at the top, select <em>Effect -&gt; Volume and Compression -&gt;
Loudness Normalization...</em></li>
<li>Do not change the default settings (-23 LUFS) and click 'Apply'</li>
<li>Press <code>Ctrl + Shift + E</code> to export</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sound-assets">Sound Assets</h2>
<p>After importing your a sound file into Unity, you get an
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-AudioClip.html">Audio Clip</a>.
You could create an
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-AudioSource.html">Audio Source</a>
in your scene and play this clip directly, but VPE allows you to construct
different types of sound assets out of one or multiple of these audio clips to
produce variation and customize how the sound is played with pinball in mind.
VPE differentiates between <strong>sound effects</strong>, <strong>music</strong> and <strong>callouts</strong>.</p>
<p>To create a sound asset, navigate to the folder where you want to create it in
your Unity project panel, right click, select <em>Create -&gt; Pinball -&gt; Sound</em> and
choose the type of sound asset you want to create. All sound asset types have
the following properties:</p>
<img src="common-sound-asset-options.png" alt="Common sound asset options" width="367" class="img-fluid float-end" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px">
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: You can enter any text here. This field is only for diplay.
Use it to describe the sound, when it should be used, how it was recorded, or
just leave it blank.</li>
<li><strong>Clips</strong>: A list of audio clips that may be selected for playback. For
frequently played sounds, such as that of a bumper, you should provide
multiple samples here.</li>
<li><strong>Clip Selection Method</strong>: How VPE decides which clip to choose each time the
sound is played.
<ul>
<li>Round Robin: The clips will be played first to last in a fixed order.</li>
<li>Random: Clips are selected at random.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Audio Mixer Group</strong>: The audio mixer group whose effects and settings will
be applied to the sound asset when played. VPE comes with a default audio
mixer group for each type of sound asset. This enables the VPE player
application to provide global volume settings to end users across all tables.
The default audio mixer is also responsible for reducing the volume of sound
effects and music whenever a callout plays. Your table will lose these
benefits if you use your own audio mixer groups.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sound-effects">Sound Effects</h3>
<p>Sound effects are the most common type of sound asset. You should generally
choose this type for any sounds other than callouts and music. In addition to
those described above, sound effect assets have the following properties:</p>
<img src="sound-effect-asset-options.png" alt="Common sound asset options" width="367" class="img-fluid float-end" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px">
<ul>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: In a real pinball machine, would this sound come from a mechanism
(Mechanical) or from the speakers (Synthetic)? When a mechanical sound effect
is played, VPE uses Unity's spatial audio system to position it in the scene
according to the object that triggered it.</li>
<li><strong>Loop</strong>: Causes the sound to loop until it is stopped according to table
logic. When enabled, additional options for fading in and out are available.</li>
<li><strong>Volume Range</strong> and <strong>Pitch Range</strong>: Two sliders with two control knobs each
that indicate a range within which volume and pitch will be randomized each
time the sound is played. This is a cheap way to produce variation if only one
audio clip is available, but it will not sound as good as multiple samples.</li>
<li><strong>Cooldown</strong>: If the sound effect is triggered again before the specified
number of seconds passes, it will not be played. This is to prevent sound
effects from playing twice at the same time, for example when the ball hits
two drop targets at once.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="callouts">Callouts</h3>
<p>Callouts are short voice lines that are typically triggered when the player does
something special, like starting multiball. The reason for the distinction
between callouts and sound effects is that callouts tend to be much more
significant to the player than other sounds. As such, their playback is managed
by a table-wide <em>Callout Coordinator</em> component at the root of the table
hierarchy that ensures callouts are played one at a time. When triggering a
callout, you can select a priority. Whenever a callout is triggered while
another is playing, it will be placed in a queue to be played later. New
callouts will 'cut in line' in front of any lower priority callouts already in
the queue. Callouts also have their own audio mixer group that lowers the volume
of sound effects and music whenever a callout is played. (This is called
&quot;ducking&quot; in audio technician lingo.)</p>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>Like callouts, music is played indirectly through requests to a table-wide
<em>Music Coordinator</em> at the root of the table hierarchy. This ensures your table
never plays multiple tracks at once, so you don't have to worry about that in
your game logic. Requests to the music coordinator are made with a priority. If
multiple requests are active at the same time, the one with the highest priority
will play. If multiple requests have the same priority, the most recent one is
played. If a new track starts while another is playing, the music coordinator
will cross-fade between them according to the <em>Fade Duration</em> setting on the
music coordinator component. Music assets always loop: When an audio clip from a
music asset finishes, the next clip is chosen according to the clip selection
method specified in the asset. This allows you to build playlists using music
assets.</p>
<h2 id="playback">Playback</h2>
<img src="editor-coil-sound.png" alt="Coil Sound Component on a bumper" width="367" class="img-fluid float-end" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px">
<p>Regardless of which game logic engine you use, VPE provides a few Unity
components to trigger the playback of sound assets. <em>Hit Sound</em>, <em>Coil Sound</em>
and <em>Switch Sound</em> are intended to trigger mechanical sound effects when the
ball hits something, a coil is energized, or a switch is closed, respectively.
You can add these components to any game objects that have another component to
supply the appropriate events. For example, a bumper component supplies all
three, because bumpers can get hit and have both a coil and a switch. If the
coil or switch that should trigger the sound is part of a device with other
coils or switches, you must select it in the drop-down menu on the sound
component. You can have as many sound components on one object as you want. If
you expect a sound to be triggered in quick succession, you may be interested in
the <em>Multi Play Mode</em> setting. It specifies what to do when the sound is still
playing when it is triggered again. These are the options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Play In Parallel</strong>: Keep playing the previous sound and start another one at
the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Do Not Play</strong>: Keep playing the previous sound and don't start another one.</li>
<li><strong>Fade Out Previous</strong>: Fade out the previous sound while starting a new one.
If the sound is not a looping sound or its fade out time is zero, this is the
same as <em>Stop Previous</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Stop Previous</strong>: Immediately stop the previous sound and start a new one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any sound that would come out of the speakers in a real pinball machine should
be driven by your game logic engine, but there is technically nothing stopping
you from triggering music or a callout when a switch is closed, for example.
Additionally, VPE provides the <em>Music Requester</em> and <em>Callout Requester</em>
components for testing purposes. These components will trigger callouts and
music as soon as they are enabled and cancel the request when they are disabled.
To get some music playing as quickly as possible, simply add a music requester
component to an enabled object in your table hierarchy and assign a reference to
the music asset you want to play.</p>
