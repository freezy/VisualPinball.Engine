	/// The function ProgressiveMesh() takes a model in an "indexed face
	/// set" sort of way.  i.e. Array of vertices and Array of triangles.
	/// The function then does the polygon reduction algorithm
	/// internally and reduces the model all the way down to 0
	/// vertices and then returns the order in which the
	/// vertices are collapsed and to which neighbor each vertex
	/// is collapsed to.  More specifically the returned "permutation"
	/// indicates how to reorder your vertices so you can render
	/// an object by using the first n vertices (for the n
	/// vertex version).  After permuting your vertices, the
	/// map Array indicates to which vertex each vertex is collapsed to.
