# Plugins

VPE has a plug-in system that allows other software to integrate with it. Plugins are typically required on a per-table basis. VPE ships with a number of default plugins which are documented here.

## [PinMAME](xref:pinmame_index)

[PinMAME](https://github.com/vpinball/pinmame) is an emulator written in C which supports most of the hardware found in pinball machines the mid 1970's until 2014.

## [Visual Scripting](xref:uvs_index)

For original games or EM machines, we recommend using our visual scripting package which extends [Unity's Visual Scripting](https://unity.com/products/unity-visual-scripting).

## [Mission Pinball Framework](xref:mpf_index)

The [Mission Pinball Framework](https://missionpinball.org/) is software written in Python that is used to drive real pinball machines. It integrates with VPE as a gamelogic engine.
