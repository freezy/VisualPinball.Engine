# Installing VPE

## Unity

In order to start creating or tweaking tables with VPE, the first thing you'll need to install is [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). You will need a developer account, which is free.

> [!NOTE]
> As long as you don't use VPE for a game that makes $100K or more in revenue or funding a year, the free [Personal](https://store.unity.com/compare-plans) plan is sufficient for you.

Unity uses an application called *Unity Hub* to update itself and provide quick access to your projects. The install process is straight-forward and documented [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html) if you run into troubles.

When installing Unity, use the latest **2020.3** version. You can leave all the other options unchecked.

Once Unity is downloaded and installed, you'll need to create a new project. Unity has multiple render pipelines, and you'll be asked which render pipeline to use in your project:

You'll have the choice between:

- **2D** - For 2D games. VPE doesn't support this renderer.
- **3D** - Unity's original built-in renderer.
- **High Definition RP** - Unity's new [HDRP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@0.0.0/manual/index.html), used for high-end platforms.
- **Universal Render Pipeline** - Unity's [URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@8.2/manual/index.html) is aimed at mobile and low-end platforms.

We recommend using HDRP. It's not as mature as the built-in renderer, but it's able to achieve better visuals, and it's what Unity will be focusing on in the future.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're just creating a throw-away project for testing out gameplay, the built-in renderer is more tested and faster to set up. We also support the URP, but it's not as well tested as the other two pipelines.

Next, enter a project name and a location for your project. We recommend putting the render pipeline into the name, because in the future you might test out other pipelines and thus need to create additional projects.

Clicking *Create* launches the Unity editor, pulls in all the dependencies for the new project, and compiles them. This will take a few minutes.

### HDRP Setup

If you create an HDRP project, Unity provides you with a sample scene: 

![HDRP Sample Scene](unity-hdrp-default-scene.png)

The sample scene is awesome but huge, so we're going to discard it and create a new one. Click on *File -> New Scene* and select the *Basic Indoors (HDRP)* template. Save it in your *Assets/Scenes* folder as `TestTable.unity`.

In this scene there's a plane that will [Z-fight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting) with our imported table later. Select it in the *Hierarchy* and move it down a little by setting the *Y Position* under *Transform* in the *Inspector* to `-0.1`. Your scene should now look like this:

![TestTable Scene](unity-hdrp-test-scene.png)

Hit *Ctrl+S* to save your scene.

## VPE Package

Now that you have your project and scene set up, let's bring VPE into the project. VPE ships as a package that you can install with the [Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Packages.html) inside of Unity directly. However, since Unity's package registry is only used for Unity, we need to add our own registry first.

In order to do that, go to *Edit -> Project Settings*, and select the *Package Manager* panel on the left. Under *Scoped Registries*, add the following:

- Name: `Visual Pinball Engine`
- URL: `https://registry.visualpinball.org/`
- Scope(s): `org.visualpinball`

Your settings page should now look like that:

<img alt="Scoped Registry" width="953" src="unity-scoped-registry.jpg" />

Hit *Save* and close the window. You're now going to add VPE's HDRP package, which will also pull in the core package and the assets package. 

Open the package manager by clicking on *Window -> Package Manager*. Then click on the "plus" icon on the top left corner of the window, and choose *Add package from git URL*.

There, enter `org.visualpinball.engine.unity.hdrp` and click *Add*. This will take a moment as Unity downloads and compiles all of VPE's dependencies. If during this time, you see the following warning:

<p><img alt="Unity Input System Warning" width="390" src="unity-input-system-warning.png" /></p>

Click *Yes*. When complete, you should now have a *Visual Pinball* menu in the editor, and you should see the following new packages in the package manager (versions will vary):

So let's [import a table](running-vpe.md)!
