# Overview

The Visual Pinball Engine (which we call "VPE") is an open-source pinball simulator that you can use to create pinball games for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It's based on the famous [Visual Pinball](https://github.com/vpinball/vpinball) (often abbreviated "VP" or "VPX" for its latest version 10), meaning VPE's physics simulation matches that in VPX, and it can read and write the same file format.

VPE uses [Unity](https://unity.com/) for its underlying game architecture. Unity is one of the leading cross-platform game engines and provides VPE with an advanced render pipeline that produces high-quality visuals and is continuously maintained and updated to work with new hardware features. Unity also comes with a fantastic editor, which VPE extends to make the table creation process as easy as possible.

## Audience

This documentation is mainly aimed at table creators ("authors"). VPE is currently not in a state where it is usable by the general public ("players"). Documentation about how to set up VPE to play will follow at a later stage.
