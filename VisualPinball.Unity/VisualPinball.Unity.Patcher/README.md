# Patching System

While we handle most of VPX's quirks in a generic way, there are things that 
are impossible to deal with because they are implemented in the table via 
script. Examples are ball- or flipper shadows, or material properties that 
cannot be reproduced the same way in the Unity renderer.

This project allows to apply changes to an imported table in a simple, 
automated and reusable way.

## How?

In order to patch something, we create a class under `VisualPinball.Unity.Patcher.Patcher`.
There are currently two sub packages, `Common` for changes likely to be applied
to all tables, and a `Tables` package with classes that concern only specific
tables.

## Matcher

Before we can patch, we need to know *what* to patch. More precisely, we need
to:

1. Identify the table
2. Identify the element we want to patch.

We use [Attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/)
to do that.

### Identify the Table

Create a matcher class by extending `TableMatchAttribute` or use one of the 
existing ones. If this matcher returns a negative value, all patch methods of
the underlying class are ignored.

For example, if you want to match a table with the file name "foo.vpx", you 
would create the attribute class like that:

```cs
public class FooMatchAttribute : TableMatchAttribute
{
	public override bool Matches(Engine.VPT.Table.Table table, string fileName)
	{
		return fileName == "foo.vpx";
	}
}
```

Then, decorate your patch class with the attribute (you can omit the `Attribute` suffix when using attributes):

```cs
[FooMatch]
public class MyTablePatcher
{
}
```

This isn't very DRY though. If matching by file name is something you're doing
a lot, you pass the file name as parameter:

```cs
public class FileNameMatchAttribute : TableMatchAttribute
{
	private readonly string _fileName;

	public NameMatchAttribute(string fileName)
	{
		_fileName = fileName;
	}

	public override bool Matches(Engine.VPT.Table.Table table, string fileName)
	{
		return fileName == _fileName;
	}
}
```

And use it like so:

```cs
[FileNameMatch("foo.vpx")]
public class MyTablePatcher
{
}
```

We already include a few matcher for you to use, [see below](#built-in-matchers).

### Identify the Game Item

Now we know how to filter the table, let's look at how to identify the
table element to patch. We use the same principle as above, but by extending
`ItemMatchAttribute` instead of `TableMatchAttribute`.

You've noticed that the table matcher classes get only the parsed table and the
file name of the table to decide whether to match or not. Since we're dealing
with table items, we get a lot more input here, namely:

- the parsed table (maybe you want to exclude some tables)
- the table item (this holds the name of the element)
- the render object (maybe the match is based on the mesh itself)
- the Unity `GameObject` (maybe the match is based on the converted object)

So, here's an example:

```cs
public class NameMatchAttribute : ItemMatchAttribute
{
	public bool IgnoreCase = true;

	private readonly string _name;

	public NameMatchAttribute(string name)
	{
		_name = name;
	}

	public override bool Matches(FileTableContainer tableContainer, GameObject obj)
	{
		return IgnoreCase
			? string.Equals(obj.name, _name, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase)
			: obj.name == _name;
	}
}
```

Let's look at how to apply this in the next section.

## Patcher

Now we know how to match an item, let's create a patch. It's as easy as
writing a `void` method in your patch class that takes in the objects you're
interested in (see below), and decorate it with an item matcher.

Let's take the name matcher from the example above and use it to hide the
flipper shadows:

```cs
[NameMatch("LeftFlipperSh")]
[NameMatch("RightFlipperSh")]
public void RemoveFlipperShadow(GameObject gameObject)
{
	gameObject.SetActive(false);
}
```

Putting several attributes on a method means that it is matched if *at least 
one* of the matchers matches (the same applies to the table matchers, by the 
way).

You can pass different types in any order to the method. Supported types are:

- `UnityEngine.GameObject` - Unity game object that was created for that game item.
- `VisualPinball.Engine.VPT.Table.Table` - The table object for which the game 
  item was created for
- Any game item type, e.g. `VisualPinball.Engine.VPT.Flipper.Flipper` that 
  extends `IItem`. If your matched game item is not of the type you've provided
  in the method signature, the patch is skipped and a warning is printed.
- Any Unity component, e.g. `FlipperComponent`, or even `MeshFilter`.
- `ref UnityEngine.GameObject` - Another game object, specified by the `Ref` 
  field of the matcher (see *Advanced Features* below).  
  
## Built-in Matchers

### Table Matchers

- `[AnyMatch]` - Matches all tables
- `[MetaMatch(string TableName, string AuthorName)]` - Matches a table  where 
  `TableName` is the table name and `AuthorName` the (exact) string of the
  authors field of the table's metadata.
 - `[TableNameMatch(string name)]` - Matches a table by the table's game item
  item name (also the table name in the table script).
- `[RenderPipeline(RenderPipelineType rp)]` - Matches if the current render
  pipeline is set to the given value.  

### Item Matchers

- `[NameMatch(string name)]` - Matches an item by its name.
- `[RenderPipeline(RenderPipelineType rp)]` - Matches if the current render
  pipeline is set to the given value. 
  
## Advanced Features

You might need to find another game object during patching, and repeat this 
over several patch methods. For that, you can use the matcher's `Ref` field,
which is a search path for the game object you'd like to find. In the patch
method, you can retrieve this using a `ref GameObject` parameter.

For example, many tables use a primitive for the flipper, that we'd like to 
re-parent to the actual flipper object. So we would do the following:

```cs
[NameMatch("RightFlipperPrimitive", Ref="Flippers/RightFlipper")]
[NameMatch("LeftFlipperPrimitive", Ref="Flippers/LeftFlipper")]
public void ReparentFlippers(GameObject gameObject, ref GameObject parent)
{
	var rot = gameObject.transform.rotation;
	var pos = gameObject.transform.position;

	// re-parent the child
	gameObject.transform.SetParent(parent.transform, false);

	gameObject.transform.rotation = rot;
	gameObject.transform.position = pos;
}  
```

## Summary

For a new table:

1. Create a patch class. Preferably at `Patcher.Tables` package. Name it 
   however you want.
2. Put a class matcher attribute on it.
3. For every element to patch, create a new method and add an item matcher 
   attribute on it.

All classes are automatically loaded, there is no need to register them 
anywhere.
