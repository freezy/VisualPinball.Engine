				// two purposes, one physically meaningful and the other a bit of
				// a hack for the physics loop.  The physical situation is that we
				// have a slow-moving ball blocking a fast-moving plunger; this
				// momentary travel limit effectively models the blockage.  The
				// hack is that the physics loop can't handle a situation where
				// a moving object is in continuous contact with the ball.  The
				// physics loop is written so that time only advances as far as
				// the next collision.  This means that the loop will get stuck
				// if two objects remain in continuous contact, because the time
				// to the next collision will be exactly 0.0 as long as the contact
				// continues.  We *have* to break the contact for time to progress
				// in the loop.  This has never been a problem for other objects
				// because other collisions always impart enough momentum to send
				// the colliding objects on their separate ways.  With a low
				// momentum transfer ratio in the plunger, though, we can find
				// ourselves pushing the ball along, with the spring keeping the
				// plunger pressed against the ball the whole way.  The plunger
				// freeze here deals with this by breaking contact for just long
				// enough to let the ball move a little bit, so that there's a
				// non-zero time to the next collision with the plunger.  We'll
