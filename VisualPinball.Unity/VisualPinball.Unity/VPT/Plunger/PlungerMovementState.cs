		/// Forward travel limit.  When we're about to collide with a ball,
		/// we'll temporarily set this so the collision location.  We set
		/// this in HitTest(), and use it (and reset it) in the next call
		/// to UpdateDisplacements().  This is expressed in absolute
		/// position coordinates, so the default value (which allows full
		/// forward travel) is m_frameEnd.
		///
		/// The purpose of this limit is to fix buggy behavior that can
		/// happen when the ball speed after a collision is slower than the
		/// plunger speed before the collision.  (In past versions, this
		/// scenario wasn't really possible, because the plunger code just
		/// gave the ball the same velocity as the plunger at the time of
		/// collision.  But this was a bit limiting; the physical process
		/// we're modeling is really a transfer of momentum, not velocity.
		/// With the addition of the Momentum Transfer property and the new
		/// accounting for the relative mass of the ball, the ball can now
		/// come out of the collision with a slower speed than the plunger
		/// had going in.)
		///
		/// The bug that this can trigger is that the fast-moving plunger
		/// can overtake and shoot past the slow-moving ball.  Left to their
		/// own devices, the two objects would just keep moving at their
		/// programmed velocities.  If the plunger velocity is faster than
		/// the ball after the collision, the plunger can shoot past the
		/// ball as though it's not there.  The best way I've found to fix
		/// this is to add this extra limit on the travel distance.  This
		/// lets us figure where the ball is at the point of collision and
		/// explicitly prevent the plunger from going past that until the

		///  1. The keyboard/script interface calls the Fire method
		///  2. The mechanical plunger moves forware rapidly
		///
		/// In either case, we calculate the firing speed based on how
		/// far the plunger is pulled back.  Since the plunger is basically
		/// a spring, pulling it back and letting it go converts the
		/// potential energy in the spring to kinetic energy in the
		/// plunger rod; the bottom line is that the final speed of
		/// the plunger is proportional to the spring displacement (how
		/// far back the plunger was pulled).  So we calculate the speed
		/// at the start of the release and allow the rod to move freely
		/// at this speed until it strikes the ball.
		///
		/// Durina a Fire event, the simulated plunger is completely
		/// disconnected from the mechanical plunger and moves under its
		/// own power.  In principle, if we have a mechanical plunger,
		/// we *should* be able to track the actual physical motion of
		/// the real plunger in real time and just have the software
		/// plunger do exactly the same thing.  But this doesn't work
		/// in practice because real plungers move much too quickly
		/// for our simulation and USB input to keep up with.  Our
		/// nominal simulation time base is 10ms, and the USB input
		/// updates at 10-30ms cycles.  (USB isn't synchronized with
		/// our physics cycle, either, so even if the USB updates were
		/// 10ms or faster, we still wouldn't get USB updates on every
		/// physics cycle just because the timing wouldn't always align.)
		/// In 20ms, a real physical plunger can shoot all the way
		/// forward, bounce part way back, and move forward again.  The
		/// result is aliasing.
		///
		/// To deal with this, we use heuristics to try to guess when the
		/// physical plunger has been released.  When we detect that it
		/// has, we simply disconnect the simulated plunger from the
		/// physical plunger and let the simulated version move freely
		/// under its own spring forces.  We ignore inputs from the analog
		/// plunger during this interval.  The real plunger can be expected
		/// to come to rest after a full release in about 200ms, so we
		/// only leave this mode in effect for a limited time, at which
