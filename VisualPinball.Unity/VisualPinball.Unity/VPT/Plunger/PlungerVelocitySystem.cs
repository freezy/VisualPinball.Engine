					// real plunger can shoot all the way forward, bounce all the
					// way back, and shoot forward again in the time between two
					// consecutive samples.  A real plunger moves at around 3-5m/s,
					// which translates to 3-5mm/ms, or 30-50mm per 10ms sampling
					// period.  The whole plunger travel distance is ~65mm.
					// So in one reading, we can travel almost the whole range!
					// This means that samples are effectively random during a
					// release motion.  We might happen to get lucky and have
					// our sample timing align perfectly with a release, so that
					// we get one reading at the retracted position just before
					// a release and the very next reading at the full forward
					// position.  Or we might get unlikely and catch one reading
					// halfway down the initial initial lunge and the next reading
					// at the very apex of the bounce back - and if we took those
					// two readings at face value, we'd be fooled into thinking
					// the plunger was stationary at the halfway point!
					//
					// But there's hope.  A real plunger's barrel spring is pretty
					// inelastic, so the rebounds after a release damp out quickly.
					// Observationally, each bounce bounces back to less than half
					// of the previous one.  So even with the worst-case aliasing,
					// we can be confident that we'll see a declining trend in the
					// samples during a release-bounce-bounce-bounce sequence.
					//
					// Our detection strategy is simply to consider any rapid
					// forward motion to be a release.  If we see the plunger move
					// forward by more than the threshold distance, we'll consider
					// it a release.  See the comments above for how we chose the
					// threshold value.

					// to measure the instantaneous speed of the plunger as the
					// difference in position divided by the time interval.  But
					// the time interval is extremely imprecise, because joystick
					// reports aren't synchronized to our clock.  In practice the
					// time between USB reports is in the 10-30ms range, which gives
					// us a considerable range of error in calculating an instantaneous
					// speed.
					//
					// So instead of relying on the instantaneous speed alone, now
					// that we're pretty sure a release motion is under way, go back
					// through our recent history to find out where it really
